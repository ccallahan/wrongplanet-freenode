# Welcome to #WrongPlanet!

Welcome to #WrongPlanet on Freenode Internet Relay Chat (IRC). This will be a tutorial for beginners to the channel, or long time users looking to refresh themselves. This assumes you are connected from the webchat client.

## Lingo
The channel has some differences in language then the forums. Here is a quick look.

* “#WP”: Just short for #WrongPlanet
* IRC: Internet Relay Chat is the internet protocol that powers this chat.
* Freenode: The IRC network providing the chatroom.
* Ops: Ops is short for operators, a equivalent of moderators on the forums. You can see a list of them click Ops List on the sidebar.
* -alt: #WrongPlanet-alt is the 16+ unmoderated chat room. You can get to it by typing `/join #wrongplanet-alt` in your text bar and pressing enter.
* Nick: Short for nickname, like you used on AOL (I know, I said a dirty word. :P)

## Nicknames

The first thing you will want to do is change your nick. Think of something unique. Then type `/nick newname` but replace new name with your unique nick. If you get a message that says something about identifying, then you need to pick another nick. In some cases, your nickname will be changed back to something generic within 30 seconds.

## The topic

The topic is like a bulletin. It give a list of important info to know. 

## /me

You might be seeing people typing text in the third person and thinking “I want to do that!” Well you can! Type /me followed by a action. e.g. `/me jumps` would look like `fubar jumps`.
