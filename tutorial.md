# The Interface
When it's fully loaded and connected you should see a blue windows. Let's walk though the components

## Channel Tabs
On the bottom of the screen is the channel tabs. You shouldn't need to mess with this normally. It should say on top #wrongplanet, and on the bottom Status.

## User List
On the right is the user list. You can scroll this up and down to see the users. You might have notice the "@" sign by ChanServ and Bot0. That means they are operators, a equivlant to moderators on the forum. You can see a list of operators on the left if you click Op List.

## Buffer/Text Box
In the center is the buffer and text box. The buffer is where you see the messages being sent and recived. Underneath the buffer is the text box. Here you can type your message and then press enter to send it.

## Topic
The topic is the topmost line of text. It tell you about any news and channel issues in progress. You can also client on the Notice Board link to see anything going on.

# How to chat
## Nickname
First thing you want to do is change your nickname. Think of something unique. Then type /nick followed by the nickname you want to use in the text box, for example: /nick cyb0rg (This nick is taken, so don't use it). 

## Sending a message
To send a message type your message in the text box and then press enter to send it. The message is then posted to the channel. 

## Actions
You may see text in purple that look like this: "cyb0rg has a cookie." This is called a action. You can do that by prefixing your message written in the third person with /me. For example /me has a cookie would produce a meesage that says "cyb0rg has a cookie."
