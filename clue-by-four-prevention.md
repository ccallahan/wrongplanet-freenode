# Clue-By-Four Prevention, or, how not to get muted and/or banned.

As of 1/24/15, BotX has logged a total of 130 combined mutes and bans since the start of the new year.

## THIS IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY STUPID. THIS IS ALSO PREVENTABLE.
The ops don't ask much. We just ask you follow the rules and do what we tell you.

## IRC ISN'T A DEMOCRACY
We have been getting users recently (you know who you are) that for some freaking reason must argue with every op decison. Then they get pissed when they get hit upside the head with a clue-by-four. Again, if we go back to the rules, it clearly says that **THE OPS HAVE FINAL SAY**. We try to be fair and even handed. But we are human too. We fuck up. It may take another op to help them realize they fucked up. But in the end, we usually can make everyone happy.

## FFS, DON'T EVADE YOUR BAN.
We measure bans on BotX time. If it has not been exactly the amount of time listed on your ban (or if none is listed, a week) plus five seconds for BotX to realize the ban is up and remove it, then you are evading. Plain and simple. If you come in before expiration time + 5 seconds, we will reban you. It's simple as that. If you are not sure when your ban expires, shoot us a email at wrongplanetops@gmail.com with the date you were banned and the nick and we will check.

## FOR THE LOVE OF HOLY TAP DANCING JESUS, DON'T ATTACK THE OPS
This goes back to IRC isn't a democracy. You start attacking a op because something doesn't go your way, expect to be hit with a Clue-By-Four. You start harassing a op, and you keep going after they tell you to stop, expect a Clue-By-Four.

### And a small request, if you wouldn't mind?
Turn off your auto-rejoin. If you have a stuck key and it is spamming the channel, we will kick you. That is for the users sanity as much as ours. If you have your auto-rejoin on, then we have to ban you. We don't like to have to ban. It's much easier to type !kick johndoe then !b johndoe 30m go fix your keyboard.
