# Rules

Everyone has to follow them, including you. Note: The Operators/Moderators have final say. If you are doing something not listed here that is disruping the chat, you will be punished at the Operator/Moderator's discretion.

## Basics

Here is a basic rundown of the rules:

### Treat others how you want to be treated
That doesn't mean when you are upset make others upset. It means treat everyone with respect.

### Don't Troll
Trolling is defined as posting messages with a clear and primary intent of provoking users into an emotional response or otherwise disrupting typical on-topic discussions.

### Obey the operators/moderators

Ops are listed in Op List. If you disobey them, you will be punished at operator/moderator's discretion.

## More detailed rules

### Usernames
* No potentially controversial names. This includes:
 * names of religious figures, 
 * names of controversial famous people
 * names that sound similar to terms that may be offensive (or distasteful to some people)

### Chatting
* Distasteful conversation is not permitted in the chatroom. This includes any topic that might be considered "gross," such as the discussion of certain bodily functions. Such conversations make some members uncomfortable and unlike the forums chat messages are read by all participating parties. 
* Racist statements sent via the channel or via PM is not permitted
* Do not post links that are not safe for work
* Posting more than 3 lines at a time is considered spamming and warrants immediate removal from the room.
* Bashing people because of their beliefs is not permitted.
* Do not use words that are not permitted on US broadcast TV (the F, C, and S words are prohibited)
* NO RELIGION DISCUSSION! All religion debates cause is people getting pissed and egos brused. If you really want to, take it to -alt. But be warned, we won't bail you out if you get cornered. You dug your hole, you gotta climb out.
* Keep discussion of WP's admin in channel to a minimum. It is allowed, but long conversations about op decisions take place where the decisions are made. There is no need to duplicate these long discussions in the main channel, to the exclusion of all other topics.

### Attacks
* Personal attacks in the channel are not permitted. In serious cases, this rule extends to PM.
* What defines an attack?
 * Calling other users names
 * Insinuation (indirectly calling other users names, without explicitly naming them)
 * Provoking other users, by continuing behaviour that they already expressed discomfort about
 * Bringing interpersonal issues into the channel from other channels (these topics should not be raised in WP at all)

### Ban Evasion
* Ban evasion is not tolerated and results in a longer ban (which may be more than 5 days). 

### Violation Consequences
NOTE: Treatment varies between ops.

Usually, upon the first violation of these guidelines, the op will publicly remind the user that their behaviour is unacceptable. Further violation would then result in a warning given, and subsequent violations could lead to quieting, kicking or banning, or any combination of those. In severe cases, such as when a user is clearly only in the channel to cause trouble, bans may be both immediate and permanent, although this is rarely the case for regular users, regardless how problematic their behaviour.
